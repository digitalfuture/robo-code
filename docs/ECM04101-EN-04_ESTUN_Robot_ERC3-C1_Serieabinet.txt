Stopping 
Method  Description  Procedure  
Power -off 
Stop The power -off stop disconnects the servo 
power source, resulting in an 
instantaneous robot stop. However, 
abruptly cutting the servo power during 
robot movement leads to uncontrolled 
deceleration.  ⚫ Activate the alarm and disconnect the servo power, 
causing an immediate stop in robot motion.  
⚫ Pause the program execution.  
Alarm 
Stop The alarm stop is a method of robot 
cessation where, upon system alarm 
(excluding power -off alarms), the robot's 
motion is decelerated and stopped using 
control commands.  ⚫ The robot system issues an alarm due to overload, 
failure, etc.  (excluding power -off alarms) ;  
⚫ The servo system sends a "C entral Stop" command, 
decelerating the robot's motion and pausing the 
program execution ;  
⚫ Disconnect the servo power.  
Hold  This method maintains servo power, and 
causes the robot to decelerate and stop.  ⚫ Cause the robot to dec elerate and stop, pausing 
program execution.

27 Chapter 3  Wiring  
3.1  Wiring Precautions  
Installation, wiring, maintenance, and inspection of the product should only be carried out by personnel 
who have received training in electrical equipment, possess sufficient electrical knowledge, and are familiar with 
electrical safety protocols.  
 ⚫ Perform the wiring or inspection only by professional technicians.  
⚫ Perform the wiring according to the rated capacity provided in the Manual.  
⚫ Make sure that all circuit connections are securely fixed.  
⚫ Do not touch the circuit boards directly with your hands.  
⚫ Integrated circuit boards may experience malfunctions due to el ectrostatic discharge.  
⚫ The robot's electric cabinet should not be opened or accessed by users.  
⚫ If the customer's power supply is unstable, it is recommended for the customer to purchase 
additional equipment such as an UPS and connect it to the robot. This will protect the 
controller and ensure stable operation, avoiding the loss of system files.  
⚫ After connecting the robot control cabinet to external devices, arrange the cables 
(including but not limited to IO cables, network cables) properly to avoid trippi ng hazards 
or equipment damage.  
 ⚫ The system must be electrically grounded to avoid fire, electric shock and bodily injury.  
⚫ Turn off the main power switch prior to wiring and inspection to avoid electric shock and 
bodily injury.  
⚫ Be sure to turn off the main power supply for at least 5 minutes prior wiring and inspection. 
There may be residual high -voltage inside the control cabinet even if power off. 
Therefore, never touch the power terminals.  
⚫ The main power supply cannot be powered on when the cabin et door is not closed, this is 
because the safety interlock so mounted would prevent the main power supply from 
powering on.  
⚫ The electric control cabinet is in E -stop mode when wiring, and any matters incurred shall 
be under the responsibility of users. Op eration inspection shall be performed once the 
wiring is done.  
⚫ Avoid frequently turning the main power on and off for the electric cabinet, and ensure 
that the time interval between each power cycle is at least 1 minute.  
⚫ The robot's electric cabinet is a d edicated control device designed with power capacity 
considerations for only a minimal amount of external I/O requirements. Therefore, it is not 
allowed for users to connect external power sources, including but not limited to 
additional axes, and definite ly not to connect power strips. Doing so may result in fault 
alarms or even cause a fire in the electric cabinet.  
Before connecting the power line of the robot control cabinet to the grid terminal , it is recommended to 
connect it to a circuit breaker or disconnector first to prevent short circuits from affecting other equipment.  The 
power supply wiring diagram for the robot control cabinet is shown below:

Figure 3 -2 Two Control Cabinets Connected in Parallel to One Circuit Breaker  
3.1.1  Selection of circuit breaker/air switch  
The robot's motion trajectory involves a repetitive acceleration -deceleration process. As a result, the control 
cabinet experiences repetitive instances of high transient current in its input. This imposes specific requirements 
on the rated current and type of upstream circuit breakers or disconnectors. Additionally, being a 
frequency -controlled industrial d evice, the design and operational principles of the robot control cabinet 
inherently lead to a certain level of leakage current.  
1. Selection of circuit breaker/air switch with leakage protector  
a) It is recommended to configure each robot control cabinet wit h a separate 10A, D -type circuit 
breaker or air switch. The leakage protector should have a sensitivity current of ≥30mA  and 
be of type B residual current device (RCD).  
b) If two robot control cabinets share one circuit breaker or air switch, use a 20A, D -type circuit 
breaker or air switch with a leakage protector of ≥30mA  sensitivity current. No other 
electrical equipment should be connected under this leakage protector to prevent additional 
leakage currents that could cause a total leakage current above 30mA  and result in a trip.  
c) If connecting multiple devices under one circuit breaker or air switch with a leakage protector, the 
current value and leakage current protection value of the air switch or circuit breaker should be 
multiplied based on the configurat ion value of a single unit.  
2. Selection of circuit breaker/air switch without leakage protector  Single -phase power supply

29 a) It is recommended to configure each robot control cabinet with a separate 10A, D -type air 
switch or circuit breaker.  
b) If two robot control cabinets share one air switch or circuit breaker, use a 20A, D -type air 
switch or circuit breaker.  
c) When connecting multiple devices under one circuit breaker or air switch, multiply the current value 
of the circuit breaker or air switch based on the configuration value of a single unit.  
3.1.2  Power Cable Selection  
ESTUN control cabinets are not equipped with input power cables. Users need to provide their wiring or 
purchase from ESTUN. When choosing cables, comply with the relevant safety standards. The recommended 
cable specificat ions are as follows.

3.8.1  Precautions for using teach pendant  
1. Handle with care and avoid dropping, throwing, or striking the teach pendant, as this may cause damage or 
malfunction. When not in use, hang it on the dedicated holder to prevent accidental dropping ;  
2. Do not use sharp objects such as screws, knives, or pen tips to operate the touch screen. This may damage the 
touch screen. Use your fingers or a stylus pen to operate the touch screen ;  
3. When no USB devices are connected, make sure to cover the USB po rts with protective caps to avoid exposing 
them to dust, which could cause interruptions or failures ;  
4. When using USB plugs, do not apply excessive force. Normal use is sufficient ;  
5. If the USB is not recognized, unplug the USB drive, power off, and then plug it back in after powering on ;  
6. When using the E -stop button or key, do not apply excessive force. Normal use is sufficient ;  
7. The power -on time is 40 S for the system to start up properly. Do not power off prematurely to avoid file loss ; 
8. Connect or disconnect the teach pendant when the control cabinet is powered off. It is prohibited to connect or 
disconnect the teach pendant while the control cabinet is powered on, as this may result in damage to the controller 
or the teach pendant.  
9. When storing cables, do not place them under heavy machinery to avoid crushing, cutting, or pulling them apart ;  
10. Follow our defined wiring guidelines to avoid connection errors and potential issues ;  
11. The teach pendant is not explosion -proof. Do not use it in explosive environments or work units ;  
12. Keep the teach pendant away from water, oil, and similar environments ;  


 
41 13. The ERC3 -C1 control cabinet is only compatible with the T76 model of teach pendant and cannot be paired with 
the T72 model.  
14. To release the E -stop, lift the E -stop button upward or rotate the button to release it. Avoid excessive rotation or 
pausing during rotation, as this may cause abnormal dual -channel detection of the sys tem, and trigger alarm codes 
A112/A113. In the event of abnormal alarms A112/A113 during non -routine operations, manually clear the alarm for 
normal operation.  
15. To correctly use the teach pendant push button, support the bottom of the teach pendant with  the palm of the left 
hand and simultaneously press the middle position of the teach pendant with two fingers of the left hand. For ease of 
operation, the push button is designed as a rectangle. Using only one finger to apply force at the upper or lower en d 
of the rectangle may result in failure to close one set of contacts, triggering alarm codes A11A/A11B. In the event of 
alarms A11A/A11B during non -routine operations, manually clear the alarm for normal operation.  
16. When switching between Manual and Au to modes using the mode switch on the control cabinet, do not pause in 
the middle position during the switch. The middle position of the mode switch is the critical point for mechanical 
contact closure. Pausing at this position may cause alarm codes A116/A 117. In the event of abnormal alarms 
A116/A117 during non -routine operations, manually clear the alarm for normal operation.  
17. If frequent switching between manual and automatic modes is required during testing, wait for 5 seconds after 
switching from ma nual to automatic mode for the system self -check to complete before switching back to manual 
mode. Rapid and frequent switching between manual and automatic modes may cause alarm code A1F due to 
incomplete self -checks. This is a normal phenomenon, and powe r cycling will resolve the issue.  
18. In manual mode, if frequent pressing of the teach pendant button is required, wait for 5 seconds after pressing the 
button before releasing it, to allow time for the system self -check to complete. Rapid and frequent sw itching between 
Manual and Auto modes may cause alarm code A1F due to incomplete self -checks. This is a normal phenomenon, 
and power cycling will resolve the issue

The ERC3 -C1 control cabinet comes standard with a variety of safety stop methods. The SAFETY IO 
interfaces are illustrated in the following diagram.  
By default, shorting jumpers are inserted into the SAFETY IO, rendering the corresponding functions 
inactive. To use th ese functions, the respective shorting jumpers must be removed, and connections must be 
estaed following the appropriate wiring methods.  
It is strongly advised not to remove the shorting jumpers if these functions are not in use, as doing so may 
trigger th e corresponding functionalities, leading to operational halts or alarms.

Caution
  Emergency stops are designated for handling urgent situations and should only be used to 
halt a robot in emergencies during its normal operation.  
 Engaging the emergency stop button when not necessary may cause the  robot to deviate 
from its normal operational trajectory. Additionally, the impact from an emergency stop can 
reduce the lifespan of the robot's reducer and increase wear on the motor brake pads. It is 
strictly prohibited to use the E -stop button for regul ar halting or power disconnection in 
non-emergency situations.

This parameter controls the timing of the holding brake (to prevent gravitational slip or sustained 
external force acting on the motor).  
1. When this parameter is positive, upon receiving the servo ON input, the /BK signal is output first, 
then aft er a delay set by this parameter, the motor excitation signal is given;  
2. When this parameter is negative, upon receiving the servo ON input, the motor excitation signal is 
given immediately, then after a delay set by this parameter, the /BK signal is out put.

This parameter is only effective when the port output parameter is configured to have /BK output.  
This parameter controls the timing of the holding brake (to prevent gravitational slip or sustained 
external force acting on the motor).  
The standard setting is to output /BK (brake action) simultaneously with servo OFF.  
Depending on the mechanical structure and characteristics of the brake, the machine may move 
slightly under the influence of gravity. At this time, using the user parameter to delay the servo OFF action 
can eliminate the movement. Using this parameter to delay the servo OFF action can eliminate this 
movement. This parameter is only effective when the motor is stopped or at low s peed.  
Pn507  Brake waiting speed  10~100  rpm 100 Immediately  
This parameter is only effective when the port output is configured to include /BK output.  
This parameter controls the timing of the holding brake (to prevent gravitational slip or sustained 
external forces on the motor).  
When the motor speed drops below the value set by this parameter after servo OFF, the /BK signal is 
output.  
Pn508  Brake waiting time  0~100  10ms  10 Immediately  
This parameter is only effective when the port output is configured to include /BK output.  
This parameter controls the timing of the holding brake (to prevent gravitational slip or sustained 
external forces on the motor).  
The /BK signal is output after the delay exceeds the value set by this parameter following servo OFF.  
The /BK signal is output if either the brake waiting speed or brake waiting time condition is fulfilled.

96 Chapter 7  Maintenance  
7.1  Maintenance precautions  
Before performing maintenance, please carefully read the following content and ensure a thorough understanding 
of the methods for safe maintenance.  
  Maintenance of the robot system must be carried out by personnel who have received safety 
training. Trained personnel refer to individuals who have undergone safety training in 
accordance with the laws and regulations of their respective countries, specifically designed 
to provide knowledge on industrial robots, their operation, teaching, inspection, and related 
regulations.  
 Do not disassemble parts that are not described in this manual or perform maintenance using 
methods diffe rent from those specified. This could result in the robot system malfunctioning 
or serious safety issues.  
 Do not enter the robot's workspace while it is powered on.  
 Always verify the robot's movement from outside the safety barrier after replacing 
componen ts.  
 Before formal operation, confirm the correct operation status of the emergency stop switch 
and safety door switch.  
  Except for maintenance operations, do not open the control cabinet cover to avoid electrical 
hazards.  
 Always replace components after turning off the power to the control cabinet and associated 
devices.  
 Do not disconnect motor connectors while the power is on.  
 Perform maintenance, inspections, and other tasks in teams of two, with one person 
maintaining a posture to imme diately press the emergency stop button and the other person 
remaining vigilant to complete the task quickly and ensure a clear path for retreat.  
  Do not disassemble parts that are not covered in this manual.  
 Maintenance personnel must keep the robot key secure, and unauthorized personnel should 
not modify programs or parameters.  
7.2  Daily inspection  
To ensure the normal functioning of the product and protect it from damage, it is necessary to perform regular 
maintenance and inspections.  
If the equipment is located in the following environments, reduce the inspection interval:   
 Temperature, humidity, dust, and vibration in the environment  
 High -temperature environment  
 Frequent start -stop situations  
 Environments with AC power and load fluctuations  
 Environments with significant vibration or impact  
 Environments with corrosive substances, such as acids or alkalis  


 
97 To ensure the proper functioning of the product and prevent damage, daily confirmation should be made for the 
following items: 
Item Content Solution 
Installation 
environment Check the control cabinet and 
surrounding cables for 
abnormalities Verify if the installation brackets are vibrating.  
Check for loose or corroded connections at cable terminals.  
Input 
voltage Input power voltage Confirm if the input voltage is within the allowable range.  
    Check for any significant load starting in the vicinity.  
Terminals Control cabinet terminals  Ensure that the bolts on both sides of the input, output, and other 
terminals are tightened. 
7.3  Regular inspection  
Regular inspections should be conducted on areas that are difficult to inspect during operation. It is essential to 
maintain the control cabinet in a clean state and effectively remove accumulated dust from the product surfac e to 
prevent dust, especially metal dust, from entering the internal components.

98  Use a soft cloth to remove dust when cleaning. Do not use equipment such as air blowers to blow 
away dust. Wind pressure can cause dust to enter the fan and the blade to rotate at a speed 
exceeding the specified speed, which may cause fan failure or affect its life. Use a vacuum cleaner 
only on the blade part, do not vacuum on the rotating part and the main body. This may cause the 
fan to fail or affect its life.
